# 2D_widget

This project was created for convenient visualization of data from another application. The widget can be easily embedded and used. Thanks to templating, it is possible to choose what data type the class will use and what data type it will be displayed in. The widget runs on OpenGL, so everything works quickly. There are many different settings that can be seen in the code. Each function has a comment, so it won't be difficult to understand.
